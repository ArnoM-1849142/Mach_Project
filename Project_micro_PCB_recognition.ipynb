    "In this project, an implementation of the backpropagation algorithm for neural networks is made and applied to the task of micro_PCB recognition. This project is made for the machine learning course [`Machine learning`](https://uhintra03.uhasselt.be/studiegidswww/opleidingsonderdeel.aspx?a=2021&i=4483&n=4&t=04) given at the joint training of kuleuven and uhasselt. The authors of this project are Molenaers Arno and Purnal Lennert.\n",

    "- [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting.\n",
    "- [`scipy`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/) for scientific and numerical computation functions and tools. "

    "First the training data will be loaded, this is the training data found on kaggle: [`micro-PCB image`](https://www.kaggle.com/frettapper/micropcb-images). This dataset has 2 subfolders test_coded and train_coded where the dataset is already split with 6.500 PCB images for the training data and 1.625 for the test data. However the average size of all these images is 1949×2126 (width×height) which is high and so will cause the program to take a long time to run. A script has been written for this called ImageScaling where all images in the dataset are rescaled to the desired resolution for the images.\n",
